- ❌ Send any data to external servers or analytics services
- ❌ Share your data with third parties

## How Your Data is Protected

### Local Processing

## Third-Party Services

CommandBar Pro may redirect you to third-party search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Perplexity) when you perform web searches. These redirections are:

- Initiated only by your explicit action (pressing Enter or clicking)
- Direct navigation to the search engine (no data passes through us)
- Subject to the privacy policies of those respective services

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the privacy practices of these third-party services.

## Children's Privacy

- The source code is available on GitHub
- You can build and install the extension yourself
- Community can audit our privacy practices

## Data Retention

- **User settings:** Stored locally until you uninstall the extension or clear Chrome data
- **Search results:** Cached temporarily in memory, automatically cleared when you close the extension
- **Browsing data:** Never persistently stored, only accessed during active use

## Your Rights and Control

You have complete control over your data:

## Changes to This Policy
